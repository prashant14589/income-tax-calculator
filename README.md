### Examples

-   <span style="color:green">Example 1:</span>

      <div style="color:green">

    For Duke (aged 25), who earns ₹ 8,25,000 per annum and invests ₹75,000 in tax free govt bonds his 2019 payable tax will be calculated as follows:

    After investment deduction

    net taxable income = ₹8,25,000 - ₹75,000 = ₹7,50,000

    out of which on first ₹1,00,00, tax is ₹0

    on next ₹5,00,000 tax is 10% i.e. ₹50,000

    and on remaining ₹1,50,000 tax is 20% i.e. ₹30,000

    so total tax payable would be ₹80,000

    total cess = ₹ 0

      </div>

-   <span style="color:green">Example 2:</span>

      <div style="color:green">

    For Gopher (aged 65), who earns ₹ 38,00,000 per annum and invests ₹1,00,000 in tax free govt bonds. His 2020 payable tax will be calculated as follows:

    After investment deduction

    net taxable income = ₹38,00,000 - ₹1,00,000 = ₹37,00,000

    Because he is above 60, he is eligible for additional deduction

    net taxable income = ₹37,00,000 - ₹75,000 = ₹36,25,000

    out of which on first ₹1,00,00, tax is ₹0

    on next ₹9,00,000 tax is 15% i.e. ₹1,35,000

    and on remaining ₹26,25,000 tax is 25% i.e. ₹6,56,250

    so total tax payable would be ₹7,91,250

    since tax is above ₹5,00,000 additional 5% cess will be added

    so cess = ₹7,91,250 \* 5% = 39,562.5

    total tax + cess payable = ₹8,30,812.5
